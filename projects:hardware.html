        <h1>15 Second Countdown Timer</h1>
        <div>
        <p>purpose: To create a 15 second coundown timer which had
        a visual output display on an 8x8 LED matrix.  The audio output was a speaker which sounded off at 3 different
        frequencies when the timer reached 0.</p>
        <p>hardware used: 12 bit ripple counter, 4 bit counter, EPROM, 4x1 Multiplexer, 3x8 decoder, LM386 Audio Amplfier</p>
        <p>lab tools used: oscilloscope, multimeter, DC power source, Digital Laboratory, function generator</p>
        <p>A video of the hardware is posted to the right, for more info please visit my Admissions Blog.</p>

        <h1>Speaker</h1>
        <div>
            <p>purpose: to design a speaker given just the basic drivers.
            The speaker box was designed using cardboard while the cone was created using foam and some stiff paper.
            It was relatively basic, but gave me a fantastic sense of how audio electronics work.</p>
            <p>hardware used: basic speaker drivers</p>
            <p>lab tools used: function generator</p>

            <p>Here are links to several Experiment Write-ups I have done this pass year in several different classes.
                The two that I am most proud of are the Microelectronics I: Diodes and Digital Logic: 2-bit Adder and EPROM.
            </p>
            <p>I don't think I can present them due to academic integrity</p>
