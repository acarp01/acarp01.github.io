        <h1>15 Second Countdown Timer</h1>
        <div>
        <p>purpose: To create a 15 second coundown timer which had
        a visual output display on an 8x8 LED matrix.  The audio output was a speaker which sounded off at 3 different
        frequencies when the timer reached 0.</p>
        <p>hardware used: 12 bit ripple counter, 4 bit counter, EPROM, 4x1 Multiplexer, 3x8 decoder, LM386 Audio Amplfier</p>
        <p>lab tools used: oscilloscope, multimeter, DC power source, Digital Laboratory, function generator</p>
        <p>A video of the hardware is posted to the right, for more info please visit my Admissions Blog.</p>

        <h1>Boggle Solver</h1>
        <div>
            <p>purpose: Final project for Data Structires in C++ course (Comp15).  Program was designed to take in a dictionary
            of words, solve a randomly generated boggle board, and score a user's answers.</p>
            <p>langauges: C++</p>
            <p>data Structures: Trie, 2D array of structs</p>

        <div>
            <p>purpose: I decided to design this site to both practice my web development skills and increase my web presence.
            Although it has a few bugs, they'll slowly be worked out as I make progress on the site.</p>
            <p>languages: HTML, CSS</p>

        <h1>Speaker</h1>
        <div>
            <p>purpose: to design a speaker given just the basic drivers.
            The speaker box was designed using cardboard while the cone was created using foam and some stiff paper.
            It was relatively basic, but gave me a fantastic sense of how audio electronics work.</p>
            <p>hardware used: basic speaker drivers</p>
            <p>lab tools used: function generator</p>
