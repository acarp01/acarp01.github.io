            <h1>Outdoors</h1>
            <p>Being from California but going to school in Boston has given me the chance to hike and bike all over.  I've backpacked
            through redwood trees and hiked the 4000 footers of the White Mountains in New Hampshire.  However, that's not nearly
            even close to the number of places I'm hoping to hike in.  This summer I'll be traveling to the Canadian Rockies and hopefully
            I'll hike a good amount when I arrive in China to study abroad next year.</p>

            <h1>Sports</h1>
            <p>As long as I can remember, sports have not only been a huge part of my life, but my families' lives as well.  In high school
            I played Varsity Basketball (shooting gaurd) and also ran track and cross country.  In addition to that, I golf, play volleyball,
            and love Ultimate Frisbee.  However, the only actualy team I'm on now is the Tufts University Quidditch Team, the Tufflepuffs!
            Don't know what I mean when I say I play Quidditch?  It's a fantastic sport with brooms, hoops, and four different
            kinds of balls.  Wait, no, really?  Yeah, really.  Recently, I was fortunate enough to travel to Harry Potter World in Florida for the Quiddtich World Cup.  Check out
            the link for the International Quidditch Association  <a href = "http://www.internationalquidditch.org/">HERE</a></p>

            <h1>Travels</h1>
            <p>Throughout the course of my life, I've been fortunate enough to be able to visit many different places, though I hope to visit
            many, many more.  At the moment I've been to 24/50 states as well as England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Shanghai, Beijing, and Guilin.
            Spring of 2014 I'll be traveling over to Hong Kong where I hope to backpack through a large portion, if not all, of Southeast Asia</p>

            <h1>Music</h1><p>I've played piano since I was about 9 years old.  I was trained mainly with Classical and Baroque, but now I just play anything
            I find fun and interesting.  Some of my favorite type of music includes a large variety ranging from REM and ACDC to Frank Sinatra and
            Edvard Grieg.  Just recently I've been getting a bit more into listening to music, looking at artists such as Donavon Frankenreiter and
            Young the Giant.</p>

            <h1>Zeta Beta Tau</h1>
            <p>I'm also currently a brother in my fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau.  Although we're a small house with around 30-40 guys,
            that's the way I like it, as I'm good friends with everybody in the house.  Last semester, two brothers in ZBT
            came to visit me in California and we took a fantastic road trip down the Pacific Coast Highway.</p>

            <h1>Pets</h1>
            <p>I currently have two pets, a big white Great Pyranees dog named Rosie and a black cat named Bonnie.
            They tend to get along, though Bonnie, the smaller cat, enjoys taking advantage of Rosie, the bigger dog,
            when she can.  I love them both, and the only sad part about having them is I only get to see them
            when I'm at home in California.</p>
